         "What is a proxy, and how can I use one?",
         "A proxy server is a system or router that provides a gateway between users and the internet. Therefore, it helps prevent cyber attackers from entering a private network. It is a server, referred to as an “intermediary” because it goes between end-users and the web pages they visit online.\n When a computer connects to the internet, it uses an IP address. This is similar to your home’s street address, telling incoming data where to go and marking outgoing data with a return address for other devices to authenticate. A proxy server is essentially a computer on the internet that has an IP address of its own.\n How a Proxy Works\nBecause a proxy server has its own IP address, it acts as a go-between for a computer and the internet. Your computer knows this address, and when you send a request on the internet, it is routed to the proxy, which then gets the response from the web server and forwards the data from the page to your computer’s browser, like Chrome, Safari, Firefox, or Microsoft Edge\n Benefits of a Proxy Server\n Enhanced security: Can act like a firewall between your systems and the internet. Without them, hackers have easy access to your IP address, which they can use to infiltrate your computer or network.\n Private browsing, watching, listening, and shopping: Use different proxies to help you avoid getting inundated with unwanted ads or the collection of IP-specific data.\n Access to location-specific content: You can designate a proxy server with an address associated with another country. You can, in effect, make it look like you are in that country and gain full access to all the content computers in that country are allowed to interact with.\n"

         "I'm a freshman at NIT Trichy, and my typical day during the week goes something like this.\n I should ideally wake up at around 5:45 am in the morning but I snooze my alarm until it’s 6:00 am. By this time, the iconic clock tower announces, quite loudly, “NIT - the pride of India, vande mataram. The time is: six o'clock.” This is followed by six chimes and effectively acts as my alarm everyday.\n(that's the culprit)\n Shortly after this I finish off whatever I have to finish every morning, relishing the only time Trichy as a city is bearably cool. Once I'm done with everything, which is by around 7:00 am, I laze around in bed on my phone catching up on the day’s news and checking the forecast (in vain) for some rain. By 7:45 am, I change into something more ‘appropriate’ for class and head downstairs to the mess for breakfast.\n At breakfast, I avoid the bread because for some reason it vaguely tastes like coconut. I eat the rubbery dosa, or the bland, uncooked poha or whatever there is because apparently breakfast is the most important meal of the day and I don't exactly have any other choice. Then I quickly drink tea and rush out of the mess by 8:15 am.\n From the mess it's directly off to the LHC (Lecture Hall Complex) which I reach by 8:20 am, since it's barely a five minute walk from the mess. I go early because I get to relish the AC in the classroom. We have our lectures from 8:30 am to 12:10 pm, with a 20-minute short break after the first two classes. This is the point where we wonder why we chose this life in the first place, and why we have to learn the basics of all the engineering disciplines when we've already chosen one as our branch.\n From 12:10 pm to 1:30 pm, it's our official lunch break. I prefer going to the mess and getting done with the meal as soon as I can (it's more of a chore than something I look forward to) before going to my room to relax until 1:20 pm or so. Then I rush to the LHC if there's a theory class, or go to Ojas (the Sciences block) for labs, cursing myself for not getting a cycle. Labs are quite variable and can end anywhere between 3:00–5:00 pm. After that, I go to the mess for snacks, if decent (a samosa or a cutlet, maybe) or back to my room.\n From 5:30 pm to 6:30 pm I usually watch a show on Prime Video, and around 6:30 pm I start to try to finish my work for the day, like records, assignments, or suggested reading. Then, around 7:30 pm, I go downstairs to either the mess or A2C (an extremely cheap restaurant) for dinner.\n I'm usually back to my room by 9:00 pm after giving biometric attendance. If I have a dreaded Cycle Test the next day, this is when I resort to reading textbooks or watching YouTube tutorials, and if I'm free, I continue to watch shows on Prime till around 12:00 am. I end up doing the latter even if there's a CT, and I'm racked with guilt, so to cope, I watch another episode. It's a nice, vicious cycle.\n I sleep by 12:30 am maximum on weekdays.\n I haven't mentioned the occasional classes being cancelled, Maggi at Aavin/Bru, sessions of soda at the Coke Station, long hours staring at the screen fooling myself that I'm being productive at the 24x7 Octagon Computer Center, and the sheer amount of non-academic activities on campus (clubs, symposiums) that break the monotony. Not to mention the fests like Festember, Aaveg and Pragyan that make enduring the academics worth it (very often looked forward to just for the food).\n(yeah, I just stole those from my Instagram)\nAll in all, a typical day at NITT for a freshman is packed, and yet most of us manage to find time to be unproductive despite it.\n"

         "First of all, an obligation is another word for a contract. If you have a contract you must do it because you agreed to. Standard means whatever the majority has decided is the normal thing to do, and ethical conduct is an agreed upon set of rules everyone chooses to follow.\n Therefor, whatever is obligated goes WAY BEYOND whatever is standard. This means everything and not just ethics.\n Ethics are a set of agreed upon rules that everyone chooses to follow in order to keep the peace in any group (family, society, work, gathering, etc.). Sort of like going to a family reunion where no one gets along. Everyone agrees to be on their best behavior even though they would rather torment each other. Following some basic ethics (keep your bad thoughts to yourself, be polite, do not talk about stuff that starts fights, etc.) will allow all these people to have a good time, and keep those negative feelings from causing problems. When different social groups come together having an agreed upon set of ethics, that all choose to follow, will help reduce conflicts.\n"

Further, most states do not allow this. But some do.\n Could you do this? Yes.\n Are you likely to do this? No, not all likely.\n Whether is law, medicine, home building, shoemaking, ad nauseum it is often extremely difficult to learn a craft without the helpful guidance of people already skilled in that art.\n …\n As an example. A friend of mine once toyed with moving to California to follow their non-degree admission process. (The wisdom of that being a very different question). Point is, this person is squarely within the class of people who “might\" do the above.\n Maybe a month ago, this friend and I were talking about a legal issue in a particular legal case. How a certain motion would be decided. In which the litigant asked for a particular remedy. (Which, in my view, was very unwise.)\n My friend was insistent that the motion should be decided in one particular way because that was the best and most just result for that litigant.\n I responded that, this simply isn't how judges decide questions. As a rough template, they look at the facts, the law of the case, what the motion asks the judge to do, and the standard (usually determined in previous cases) for making any particular decision. There are reasons judges deviate from this--but that's sort of the place you start from.\n And in this particular case, the remedy was something that a sensible judge would probably not entertain because it “went too far\", would prolong the dispute, involved the court too much in trying to monitor the parties, and there was just nothing in the statute which governed the case covering this unusual request.\n My friend disagreed. Because the judge should do X. It made sense to him, so that was what should be done.\n …\n One do the skills that lawyers must develop is separating (1) advocacy for some cause, from (2) what anticipated outcomes might be reasonable or more probable.\n This is not as simple as it sounds. There are many unwritten rules and practices. Things that people care about when making decisions. Ways that parties lie or are less than honest. Patterns that recur over and over again. Without guidance, it would be quite difficult to bring yourself up to a seasoned practitioner in… many many years.\n"

Anonymous Proxy\n While accessing the online websites the Anonymous Proxies provide the fake IP address to the websites instead of your actual website address.\n Anonymous proxies provide more control over your online identity because it hides your IP address but your connection is not as much as private in the VPN. Which hides your IP address and also encrypt the traffic.\n Sometimes some website detects the Anonymous proxies and they do not allow the user to access the website using anonymous poxy.\n 3. Distorting Proxy\n Distorting proxy introduced itself as proxy service to the website and hides the actual information of proxy in use and provide the fake information.

         "Why was Michael Jordan not drafted #1 overall when he was clearly the best college player at the time? Who's to blame?",
         "Portland had the #2 pick and had their “Michael Jordan” with Clyde Drexler at that time, so the Trail Blazers felt it didn’t make sense to go with a player similar to what they had already. Houston picking Hakeem Olajuwon at #1 was a solid choice and generally isn’t argued that MJ should have gone #1 when Olajuwon had an outstanding career himself.\n To answer your question of who’s to blame: Nobody. That’s how the Draft goes. Teams pick players that turn into stars, duds, and everything in between.\n Unfortunately for Portland, a similar situation happened over 20 years later when they took Greg Oden with the #1 pick, with Kevin Durant going #2…\n"

         "Why do conspiracy theorists need to believe in their theories?",
         "For many, diverse reasons.\n For one thing, our minds are designed to try to find order even when there isn’t any. That’s why such phenomena as pareidolia (e.g. seeing a face appear among the random dots on a floor tile) exist.\n So one of the attractive things about conspiracy theories is that they provide a sense of meaning and order behind the chaos of life, current events, etc. So a pandemic for some can turn into attempts by Bill Gates to promote 5G. Even such an inherently insane, unevidenced claim has appeal to some because it’s more comfortable to believe everything is part of the plan than what is best summed up as “shit happens”. It also gives people something to actually rail against and protest against, vs adopting the feeling that they are helplessly and futilely being cast about by the whims of chance.\n Sometimes it offers a simple explanation to something that has complex, interacting causes. It is simplistic thinking that allows one to think an unsusual snowstorm is more important evidence than complex interactions between global warming, climate systems, ocean currents, etc, or to ignore data showing worldwide warming trends. Local weather is a simple, visceral experience.\n And it can give someone a sense of superiority over others that they might otherwise lack. It’s a bit like “I may never have done well in school or gotten a good job, but I’m still smarter than you sheeple and them-there scientists.” Etc. It’s like the many irrational bigots on Quora who go around accusing others of being irrational bigots. And all evidence to the contrary of their beliefs becomes more evidence, instead, of The Big Conspiracy or The Big Homogenous Mass With Faults That Isn’t Me. How does your local GP whose wife died from cancer benefit from covering up the Cure? Who the hell knows, but the conspiracy theorist who also lost a wife to cancer will still be angry at that GP, because, god forbid that people are just sometimes powerless.\n And in some cases it gives people a scapegoat. “The reason I never did well is because the Man kept me down”. So you have Incels blaming everyone else for their lack of personality, poor hygiene, etc. And it is why governments like blaming the latest boogeyman (one minority or another) for their own failure to solve every problem, while blaming opposition parties for failing to solve Every Problem Ever including cancer or 3000 years of war — so they can get re-elected.\n That said, the world is actually full of conspiracies, from the small scale (a group of friends getting together to plan a prank) to the large scale. So it is sometimes a bit too easy to believe in conspiracies that only exist in one’s mind.\n After all, a complete lack of belief in conspiracies may be just a delusional as a belief in a particular conspiracy.\n You do have groups of politicians getting together and figuring out that the way around equal rights laws is to come up with something like Jim Crow laws. Or that the way to get around the popular vote is to engage in gerrymandering. The US government did really experiment on people (MK-Ultra, the Tuskegee Airmen). People with connections have really conspired to allow people to get away with murder (lynchings of blacks). There really were Russian spies in the US in the 1950s (although Joe McCarthy started a total witch hunt over it in order to promote himself). And there are some major conspiracies that are taught in schools (the Boston Tea Party), and some that have had a profound effect upon large populations.\n There are even conspiracies that involve making people believe in false conspiracies. In early 20th century Russia, for example, anti-semites managed to create the false belief in a world-wide conspiracy of Jews by fabricating the document The Protocols of the Elders of Zion. Henry Ford of Ford Motor Company fame got ahold of a copy eventually, bought into it, published it in his Dearborn Independent gazette and otherwise transmitted it to others, including Adolph Hitler who praised Ford in his book Mein Kampf. There are many other examples of such deliberate disinformation where people ironically form a belief in ideas or even conspiracies while being a victim of a conspiracy themselves. Result? The deaths of millions of innocent Jews in Russia and Europe.\n Which goes to show you have your Alan Joneses, KKK members, neo-Nazis, and others who are just plain racist, bigoted, sexist, profit-seeking users and abusers who find utility in promoting conspiracies.\n And sometimes people are, quite simply, correct. No, NOT flat-earthers, or anti-vaxxers or people denying the moon landing or global warming. They’re completely delusional. But, per above, conspiracies do actually exist, and those who uncover them may be doing the world a huge service by doing so. Whether it is exposing industrial pollutors, government abuses, or whatever else. And that drive to do something good may in fact be the driving force behind some conspiracy theorists.\n"

For example, you will need to provide your full name, address, and phone number so that eBay can contact you if there are any issues with your account. Additionally, you will need to provide your credit card information so that eBay can charge sales tax on your transactions. Finally, you will need to provide a photograph of yourself and a copy of your driver's license or passport so that eBay can verify your identity.\n Once you have completed these steps, you will be ready to start listing items for sale on eBay. As long as you abide by the rules and regulations of eBay, selling on the site should be pretty straightforward. However, make sure to read the seller guidelines carefully before listing anything so that you know exactly what is allowed and what is not.\n"

So could provide you with an insight about the same.\n The finest college to acquire a B.Design degree from is LPU because it provides team-based and individual courses that will equip its students for work in a vibrant and intriguing sector. That, I must say, is the greatest. Undergraduates at this location work in a variety of disciplines within the quickly expanding digital economy, including engineering, education, film, and video games, among others.\n LPU believes that working on actual projects will provide its students with experience, improve their analytical and problem-solving abilities, and give them a greater grasp of how things operate in the real world. The program is run on top-tier workstations outfitted with the newest industry-specific applications. This instructor provides a larger emphasis than other instructors on the development of design thinking and in-depth practical training, according to our analysis of graphic design courses for Print Media, Interactive Media, and Motion Graphics. There is always the opportunity for LPU students to continue their studies at prestigious universities both nationally and abroad.\n Discussing self-employment, modelling, rigging, and VFX specialists, lighting and texturing artists, 3D animators, camera trackers, and compositors are a few possible career paths for someone with a degree in computer animation and visual effects. Freelancers, graphic designers, illustrators, comic book creators, pre-press artists, graphic designers, and instructors now have additional career options.\n The average package was 4.9 LPA, and the maximum package given to LPU's B Design students was 23 LPA. Amazon, Green Gold Animation, Optmyzr, Technicolor, Pratilipi, Genymedium, Goodera, Speed Records, Esperanza, Xoxoday, Fico, Optum, Temenos, Valuefy, Wheebox, Fotografik Enterprises, Eclerx, Chegg, Easy Diner, Ehues, Eight Network, Tutor Eye, Bali Enterprises, Sculpting Together Arts Studio, and many more companies visited for campus placement\n Hope this helps!\n Thank you:)\n"
